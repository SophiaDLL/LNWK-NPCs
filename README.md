**What is BSD-NPCs?**
BSD-NPCs is a powerful, open-source NPC spawner built specifically for FiveM servers. Designed with both performance and usability in mind, it allows server owners and developers to spawn, update, and manage NPCs in real time, all through a modern and intuitive user interface.

Unlike many outdated or static NPC spawners, BSD-NPCs is actively maintained and continues to evolve with the needs of the community. It provides a clean and efficient workflow for creating immersive in-game environments with ease.

**Key Features:**
Live NPC Spawning: Instantly create NPCs while the server is running, without needing to restart or reload scripts. Changes appear in-game as soon as they’re made.

**Real-Time Editing:** Move, modify, or remove existing NPCs on the fly. Adjust positions, behaviors, models, and more—all with immediate feedback.

**Clean and Modern UI:** Built with usability in mind, BSD-NPCs features a sleek interface that’s easy to navigate, even for beginners. No clunky menus or outdated tools.

**Open Source & Community Driven:** BSD-NPCs is fully open source, meaning anyone can contribute, customize, or extend its functionality. The project is actively developed and updated based on user feedback and evolving best practices.

**Lightweight & Optimized:** Designed to minimize server load while maintaining high performance and flexibility.

**Who is it for?**
Whether you're a server administrator building complex roleplay scenarios, a developer prototyping new features, or a content creator looking for dynamic NPC interactions—BSD-NPCs gives you full control over your environment with minimal setup.
